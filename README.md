#How It Works
Application for Virtual ID:

Students can apply for a virtual ID through the system if they have misplaced or lost their physical ID.

The system generates a virtual ID with a specified validity period based on the reason for issuance.

Access via Card Scanner:

Students can tap their virtual ID on card scanners located at building entrances.

The system grants access based on the validity of the virtual ID.

Access via Facial Recognition:

For buildings without card scanners, security guards at the reception desk maintain a list of students with virtual IDs.

Students can scan their faces on a tablet to verify their identity and gain access.

Exam Attendance:

During exams, invigilators can scan students' faces to mark attendance, ensuring security and authenticity.
